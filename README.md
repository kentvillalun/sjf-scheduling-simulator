# Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling Simulator

A web-based simulator that demonstrates how the Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU scheduling algorithm works through an interactive and visual interface.

---

## ✅ What it does

- Simulates the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm
- Accepts multiple processes with burst times
- Automatically calculates execution order
- Displays scheduling results clearly for easier understanding
- Helps students visualize how SJF works in operating systems

---

## 💡 Why we built it

This project was built as part of an academic group project to better understand CPU scheduling algorithms, specifically Shortest Job First.

As the team leader, I handled most of the development work, focusing on:
- Translating the SJF logic into an interactive web app
- Making the simulator easy to use and visually clear
- Applying modern frontend tools to an OS-related concept

## 🧩 Challenges solved

- Translating the SJF algorithm into clear frontend logic
- Handling dynamic user inputs without breaking calculations
- Keeping the UI simple while still informative
- Ensuring correct execution order and results
- Making the simulator responsive and user-friendly
